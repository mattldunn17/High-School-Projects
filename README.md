Cloud.class
CloudViewer.class

This is a small fun project I made in high school. It is a small window pop-up that randomizes black dots throughout the window screen. When the size of the window is readjusted, the dots re randomize, creating a cloud-like visual.



AstroRacer.py

Astro Racer was a game I made my senior year of high school using a python package Turtle Graphics. It can be played with one or two players.
